
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,160
Hello. This is 6 Minute English

00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,520
from BBC Learning English.

00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,160
I'm Sam.
And I'm Neil. The 20th of

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,040
July 1969 was a big day in

00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,040
history. Do you know why, Sam?
Wasn't that when Neil Armstrong

00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,560
first set foot on the Moon?
Right. But it's often forgotten

00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,080
that some of the most dramatic

00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,440
photographs taken on the

00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,120
Apollo space mission weren't

00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,800
of the Moon at all - they

00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,880
were of Earth. It wasn't

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,080
until we went to the Moon

00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,360
that we really saw the

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,880
size of Earth's oceans

00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,320
and named ourselves,

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,680
the Blue Planet.
Despite most of our planet

00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,960
being covered by water,

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,800
the ocean remains of place

00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,960
of unexplored mystery, of

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,160
sea monsters like

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,760
Moby Dick, and the Kraken.

00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,600
In this programme, we'll

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,720
be diving into the

00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,480
deep seas, seeing some

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,840
of its strange sights,

00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,360
and as usual, learning

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,560
some related vocabulary too.
But before that I have a

00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,240
question for you, Sam.

00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,360
You were right when you

00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,640
said that most of the

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,360
Earth is covered

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,720
by water. But do you

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,240
know exactly how much

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,360
of the Earth's surface

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,320
is ocean? Is it:
a) 50 percent?
&nbsp;

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,520
b) 60 percent? or,
c) 70 percent?
&nbsp;

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,440
Well, it is called

00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,640
the Blue Planet, so

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,880
I ll say c) 70 percent.
OK. I'll reveal the answer

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,320
later in the programme.

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,520
The first thing to say

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,120
about the deep ocean is

00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,320
that the rules of life

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,520
down there are very

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,880
different from the rules

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,400
on land. Sunlight

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,360
cannot reach the very

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,320
bottom of the ocean,

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,520
a place between two and

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,640
three kilometres down

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,160
known as the 'deep abyss',

00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,160
so it totally dark and

00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,760
extremely cold. And the

00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,280
weight of water creates

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,120
massive amounts of pressure.
This extreme environment is

00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,960
stranger than fiction, and

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,240
home to things which seem

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,760
to be from another planet;

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,160
things like hydrothermal

00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,320
vents - volcanic hot springs

00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,360
which break through the

00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,760
ocean floor. Oceanographer,

00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,360
Alex Rogers, joined an

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,880
expedition which discovered

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,320
a hydrothermal vent in

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,920
the ocean near Antarctica.

00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,080
He told his story to BBC

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,440
World Service programme,

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,440
Discovery:
Well, the first problem is

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,720
actually finding them

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,400
because they cover a very

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,240
small area so it's

00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,280
literally like trying to

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,880
find a needle in a haystack,

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,280
but when you do come across

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,560
them, I mean, the deep ocean

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,400
is food limited, so life

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,760
is quite thin on the ground,

00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,520
and then suddenly your

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,840
camera just stumbles into

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,880
this area where there is

00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,200
just abundant life all

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,800
over the sea floor and

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,280
around these vents.
Alex says that finding

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,720
these small thermal vents

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,000
at the bottom of the ocean

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,280
is like finding a needle

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,040
in a haystack, an idiom

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,560
meaning almost impossible

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,320
to find because the area

00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,280
you have to search

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,480
is so large.
Because there's no sunlight

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,000
on the ocean floor, it's

00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,120
hard for plants and

00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,040
creatures to survive, so

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,960
forms of life are thin

00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,640
on the ground - there are

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,800
only a few of them. Alex

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,400
cannot find anything to film

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,760
with his camera, until

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,520
suddenly he nears the vent

00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,600
and sees plants and animals

00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,680
everywhere. Here, there is

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,360
more than enough, or

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,400
abundant life.
To picture a hydrothermal

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,160
vent, imagine an underwater

00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,480
volcano. Billowing clouds of

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,920
what looks like smoke

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,280
heat the seawater to a

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,040
temperature of 386 degrees C.

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,160
This creates a warm

00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,520
environment of all kinds

00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,560
of weird and wonderful

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,000
creatures, including vent

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,600
mussels, tube worms and

00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,360
blind 'yeti crabs', so

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,400
called because of their

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,680
hairy claws, some of

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,040
which get cooked because

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,000
the water is so hot.
What's amazing is that

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,520
while these vents may be

00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,360
as old as Earth itself,

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,720
they were only discovered

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,600
in the 1970s. So, are

00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,040
there more mysteries hiding

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,640
in the deep ocean? That's

00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,080
the question BBC World

00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,160
Service's, Discovery, asked

00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,560
marine biologist, Kerry Howell.

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,880
Here's what she said.
I have absolutely no doubt

00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,560
that there is plenty more to

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,320
discover down there. It's really

00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,680
vast, I mean it's quite hard to

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,200
get your head around how vast

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,480
the deep sea is, and it is

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,480
most of our planet. So... and

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,600
we've barely scratched the

00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,080
surface of exploration of this

00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,200
unique environment, and if

00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,560
you think that vents were

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,720
only discovered in the 70s,

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,920
you know, there's great

00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,120
potential for a lot else

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,320
to come, I think. We've only

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,200
been exploring this

00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,640
environment for the last

00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,480
150 years, I mean. Before

00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,600
that we didn't think

00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,400
there was any life down

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,680
there at all. So, it's

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,520
a very young science is

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,880
Deep Sea biology. And so,

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,600
there's... yeah, there's

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,560
a lot more to discover.

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,680
I have no doubt.
In terms of ocean

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,960
exploration Kerry thinks

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,320
we've only scratched the

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,520
surface - found out a

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,960
little bit about something,

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,840
but not enough to

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,640
fully understand it.
That's because the ocean

00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,960
is vast - extremely big.

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,440
So vast, in fact, that it's

00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,640
hard to get your head

00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,640
around it, or difficult

00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,360
to really understand.
But how vast, exactly,

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,280
Sam? In my question I asked

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,240
how much of the Earth's

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,760
surface is covered by water.
&nbsp;

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,720
And I said it was c) 70 percent.
Which was the correct answer!

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,280
Well, 71 percent to be precise,

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,800
but either way it's hard to

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,000
get your head around or

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,680
difficult to fully understand.
OK, we'd better recap the

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,200
other vocabulary too,

00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,720
starting with the idiom,

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,200
finding a needle in a haystack

00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,400
meaning that something is

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,640
almost impossible to find

00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,440
because you have to

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,800
search so widely for it.
If something is thin on the

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,320
ground, there's very little

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,080
of it, but if it's abundant,

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,200
there's plenty or

00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,000
more than enough.
When you only scratch the

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,760
surface, you find out a

00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,200
little about something,

00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,160
but not enough to

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,960
fully understand it.
And finally, vast is

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,920
another way of saying

00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,960
extremely large,

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,320
huge or enormous.
Unlike the vast oceans,

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,760
our time is limited to

00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,040
just six minutes and

00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,640
it's up. So, join us

00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,840
again soon for more

00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,200
